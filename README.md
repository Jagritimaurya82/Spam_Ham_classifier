This Spam Ham classifier will predict whether the SMS is Spam or Ham by using Natural Language Processing(NLP)
## (Natural Language Toolkit)NLTK: NLTK is a popular open-source package in Python. Rather than building all tools from scratch, NLTK provides all common NLP Tasks.
#### Steps which I have followed in this project

**Step-1**: Remove all unnecessary symbols like ; , ' , . etc.

**Step-2**: Remove all character except (a-z and A-Z) and replace with space.

**Step-3**: Convert sentences into lower case.

**Step-4**: Split each and every sentences(list of words).

**Step-5**: Remove all stopwords like (of, from, and, our etc).

**Step-6**: Apply Bag of word method to convert words into vectors.

**Step-7**: Split the train and test dataset.

**Step-8**: Train Naive Bayes Classifier.

**Step-9**: Create Confusion matrix to check accuracy.
